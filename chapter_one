Displaying Information in Python
To display infomation in Python in simple english term to print, is simply by wrtiing the print command. Cool! Let's print our 
very first program.

print("Hey The Exception Programmer")
print("I am excited you are here")
print("Hey My goal is to expertise in Python")
print("Yes, I am determined!")
print("So will you join me?")
print("Oh yes, why not I like programming!")
print("Okay, let's dive into it!")

Make sure you type all the 7 print statements or more!

Now, you've learnt how to display or print information on screen. But, I don't wantto write all those print statements? Isn't there a better way? 
Of course there is, and you can just write all that statement in one single line of code. By using a special character called the escape - "\n"
Escape character will tell Python to move to the next line. Let's write our code now.

print("Hey The Exception Programmer\n I am excited you are here\n Hey My goal is to expertise in Python\n Yes, I am determined!")
