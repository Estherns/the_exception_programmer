Hey The Exception Programmer! 

Let me start by congtartualting you for taking this bold step of expertising in Python. Now being an excepional programmer does not come 
easily and therefore requires a few things. 

So how do we achieve our goal? Let's set some few rules to guide us through our programming journey;
1. Do not copy paste codes
2. Do all excerises
3. Code daily
4. Think like a programmer
5. Don't quit, again I say Don't quit...never ever quit!
